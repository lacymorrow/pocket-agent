# Interacting with Cursor via `cursor_debug.py`

The Python script [cli-control-cursor-ide/cursor_debug.py](mdc:cli-control-cursor-ide/cursor_debug.py) provides a command-line interface to interact with a running Cursor application instance.

## Connection Method

It establishes a connection to Cursor by leveraging the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), typically connecting to `localhost:9223` (ensure Cursor is started with `--remote-debugging-port=9223`).

## Key Capabilities

1.  **Sending Input:** The script can simulate user input, including:
    *   Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Cmd+Shift+P).
    *   Single key presses.
    *   Typing text.
    This is primarily used to interact with Cursor's AI chat/composer.

2.  **Reading Page Content:** The script includes functionality to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the Cursor window using `Runtime.evaluate` via CDP. This allows it to:
    *   Attempt to extract text content from the UI (e.g., using `document.body.innerText`).
    *   Potentially query DOM elements for more specific information.

## Usage Examples

*   Sending a message to the AI: `python cli-control-cursor-ide/cursor_debug.py "Hello Cursor"`
*   Attempting to read all visible text from the Cursor window: `python cli-control-cursor-ide/cursor_debug.py --read-text`

This script is essential for programmatically controlling or extracting information from Cursor.
