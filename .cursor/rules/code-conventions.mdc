# Code Conventions

When modifying or extending the Pocket Agent codebase, follow these conventions:

## Logging

1. Use the custom logging functions for all messages:
   - `log()` for general information (replaces `console.log`)
   - `logError()` for error information (replaces `console.error`)

2. All log messages should:
   - Be prefixed with "Pocket Agent:" for easy identification
   - Be descriptive and include context-specific details
   - Include error details when applicable

## Error Handling

1. Use try/catch blocks around all CDP operations and network communications
2. Return `null` instead of throwing errors in non-critical functions
3. Always clean up resources in finally blocks (e.g., closing WebSockets)

## WebSocket & CDP Communication

1. Set appropriate timeouts for all CDP operations (default: 10000ms)
2. Clean up event listeners after use
3. Include error, message, and close handlers for all WebSocket connections

## File Organization

As the project grows:

1. Keep related functionality in dedicated files
2. Use descriptive function and variable names
3. Document new functions with JSDoc comments
4. Maintain the extension's current modular architecture

## Environment Variables

1. All configurable values should use environment variables with sensible defaults
2. Document any new environment variables in the [project overview](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-overview.mdc)
