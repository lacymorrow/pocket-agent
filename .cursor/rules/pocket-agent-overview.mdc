# Pocket Agent: Project Overview

This project, Pocket Agent, is a VS Code extension designed to capture AI chat conversations from the Cursor editor and display them in a dedicated web interface. This allows for easier review and access to chat history across multiple workspaces.

## Core Components

The system is composed of two main parts:

1.  **VS Code Extension**: This component runs within VS Code. Its primary responsibilities include detecting active Cursor chat windows, extracting the HTML content of these chats, and identifying the workspace associated with each chat.
    *   Main logic file: [src/cursor-plugin.js](mdc:src/cursor-plugin.js)

2.  **Backend Server**: An Express.js application that receives chat data from the VS Code extension. It stores this data and serves a web page where users can view the collected chats in a tabbed interface, with each tab representing a different chat session/workspace.
    *   Main logic file: [src/server/index.js](mdc:src/server/index.js)

The interaction between these components enables the capturing and viewing of chat logs. The extension periodically sends updates to the server, which then makes them available through its web interface.
